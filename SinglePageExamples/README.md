ModelArrayNewItems
------------------
A simple JSON (client) model with a couple of bindings: a property binding on a Button and an aggregation binding on a List. When the data on which the JSON model is based is changed in the background, all up-to-date values are correctly shown in the controls through the bindings once the updateBinding() method is called.
